Fumarate Hydratase (FH) null cells accumulate vast amounts of intracellular fumarate (>10mM). I am interested in changes of the proteome in fumarate-hydratase null cells and in particular, I would like to use TMT-10 plex to obtain relative differences in the abundance of enzymes of metabolic pathways between FH KO and WT cells. Pathways of interest include glycolysis, fatty acid biosynthesis/oxidation, oxidative phosphorylation, urea cycle and the TCA cycle. UOK262 cells were derived from a retroperitoneal metastasis in a lymph node from a female patient with a primary renal tumour caused by a point mutation in fumarate hydratase (FH). UOK262pFH cells were then derived from UOK262 cells by complementation with functional human FH. Hence, we use UOK262pFH as the control cells for UOK262. For both UOK262 and UOK262pFH cells, between 8-10 million cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1X PBS and immediately scraped into Eppendorf tubes on ice. After pelleting at 1300g for 3 min at 4 degrees, the supernatant was discarded and the pellets snap frozen in a dry-ice freeing mixture."PR528	20.01.15	8-plex TMT	Full proteome	Tyrakis	Griffiths	kidney derived	Mouse		"For both FH wild-type, knock out and complemented cells, between 8-10 million cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1X PBS and immediately scraped into Eppendorf tubes on ice.

CTCF has been implicated as a tumour suppressor gene: Ctcf haplodeficient mice develop multiple spontaneous tumours, and CTCF mutations have been identified in human malignancies. Our study will investigate how altering the genomic concentration of CTCF impacts genome organisation and stability. To accomplish this, we will combine a genetically engineered mouse model lacking one copy of Ctcf with functional genomics and proteomics experiments. **homogenization using QIAGEN TissueLyzer 20Hz for 1min in 400ul TEAD with 5mm steel ball.

To further explore liver adaptations in the NMR, we plan to characterize the NMR liver proteome and compare it with that of other rodents, such as mouse and rat.
